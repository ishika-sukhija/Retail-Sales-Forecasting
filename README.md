# Retail-Sales-Forecasting

Dataset Explanation
Dataset Overview:

Description: The dataset contains historical retail sales data, including various features relevant to sales forecasting. It might include features such as date, store ID, product ID, sales volume, promotions, and other contextual variables.
Size: The dataset is large enough to support meaningful analysis and model training, with over 100k records and multiple features.
Features: The dataset includes categorical features (e.g., store locations, product categories), numerical features (e.g., sales figures, promotions), and potentially time-related features (e.g., dates, seasonal trends).
Challenges: The dataset contains missing values, slangs, abbreviations, and incomplete text, which require preprocessing and feature engineering for effective model training.
Preprocessing Steps:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are addressed using imputation or removal techniques to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Features are created or transformed to enhance model performance, including encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
Data Cleaning: Involves correcting inaccuracies and standardizing formats, especially for text-based features.
Code Explanation

Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression) to train on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of each model using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.
Results Visualization: Provides visualizations of model performance and data insights.
Key Components:

Data Preprocessing Scripts: Handles data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.
Model Training Scripts: Includes code for training different machine learning models and tuning hyperparameters.
Evaluation Scripts: Calculates performance metrics and compares model effectiveness.
Visualization: Generates plots and charts to visualize data distributions and model performance.
Dependencies:

The code relies on libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and possibly others for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
Execution:

Setup: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is correctly loaded.
Run Scripts: Execute the scripts in the specified order to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
Review Results: Analyze the output to understand model performance and make informed decisions about the best approach for forecasting.
